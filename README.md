This is my BSLE speed run. Including creating the github account and uploading, it took 26 minutes using ChatGPT-4-turbo, paid version.
Biggest issue was my novice use of AI promting. The AI kept stopping to ask me what I wanted to do next. I could have saved probably three minutes.
I did not test the code. You can guess whether or not I even opened the PDF or Text file.
I uploaded the zip file to the github to show the full file directory. GitHub wouldn't upload the empty folders.
